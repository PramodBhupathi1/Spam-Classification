# Spam-Classification

Dataset is from Kaggle

# Description:
The Spam Email Classification Dataset is designed for training machine learning models to differentiate between spam and non-spam (ham) emails. This dataset contains a collection of email messages, each labeled as either 'spam' or 'ham', providing a basis for supervised learning tasks.

# Dataset Structure:
EmailText: The text content of the email.
Label: The classification label, either 'spam' or 'ham'.

# Usage

This dataset can be used for various machine learning tasks, including but not limited to, spam detection, natural language processing (NLP), and text classification. To use this dataset, import it into your data processing tool of choice (e.g., Python Pandas) and split it into training and test sets as required for your model development.

# Prerequisites:
To run this notebook, you will need:

Jupyter notebook environment (e.g., Jupyter Lab, Google Colab)
Python 3.x
Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc.
